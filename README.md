## Misc
==============================

- The development of this program is for educational purpose.
- This program was written from scratch, but was heavily inspired by [ani-cli](https://github.com/pystardust/ani-cli)
- I don't support piracy, thus I won't add a download feature.
- Currently, video quality is maxed at 480p and some shows aren't accessible because one needs to have an account at Bilibili to access those.
- Converting subtitle might take a while.
- Be warned that this code is still messy. I haven't written any comments, and such.
