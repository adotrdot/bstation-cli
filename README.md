## Misc
==============================

- The development of this program is for educational purpose.
- I don't support piracy, thus I won't add a download feature.
- Currently, video quality is maxed at 480p because one needs to have an account at Bilibili to access a quality higher than that, and subtitle is not yet available when watching.
- Be warned that this code is still messy. I haven't written any comments, and such.
